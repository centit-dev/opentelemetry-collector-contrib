# Nginx Processor

A workaround processor to move k8s attributes from span attributes to resources attributes generated by nginx-otel image so the ks processor can extract k8s metadata for the spans.

This processor should be placed before the k8s processor and should be removed after the nginx-otel supports resource attributes.
